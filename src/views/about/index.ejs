  description: "When I was a child, I saw a playworker drawing on a small piece of paper: a beautiful forest drawn with a black ballpoint. I was astonished, so I asked if I could have it. When I got home I threw away hundreds sheets of paper trying to reproduce it, adding my own flavor to it. That’s how I started drawing. I now rarely do it anymore, but I cherish that small piece of paper to this day."
